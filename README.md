# Firebase_Train_Scheduler

This project is mainly based on showing train timings based on current time. The operator or official would only put the name and first time the train is starting for the day. The app should show the train name, destination, next arrival and frequency in minutes of arrivals. 

The app is written in HTML and Javascript & jQuery, styled with CSS and Bootstrap. In addition, GitHub is used for collaboration and go live, besides VS Code as the editor.
